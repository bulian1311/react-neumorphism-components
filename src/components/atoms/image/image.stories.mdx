# Image

Responsive images made easy. Images take time to load (if they load at all), for that is a good practice to
reserve the space before loading the image to avoid the page to jump around.

This Component also allow you to setup a fallback image in case the image its not loaded correctly,
try on the `Canvas` tab changing the src control to a unexisting image route and see what happens

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Image} />

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Image} name="Image" />
</Canvas>
